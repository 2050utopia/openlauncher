# Notice

Currently there are a lot of issues and we are not able to fix all at a time, so please be patient if the issue is still opening. And I and the team are going to review the structure of the launcher as it is very bad as I wrote them a long time ago, so there won't be any UI redesing and new feature coming so certainly. Thanks for heading over and your support.
